## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure email and password-based authentication for user accounts with a registration and login page. I have included additional options to allow users to log in using their Google account.

- **Protected Routes**: Private routes ensure that only authenticated users can access certain pages. Proper redirection to the login page is enforced if the user is not logged in.

- **Product Management**: Add, update, and delete products with necessary information such as image, name, brand, type, price, description, and rating. Users can add products to their cart and view the cart items.

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across different devices including desktop, tablet, and mobile.

- **404 Page**: A custom 404 page is implemented to handle any undefined routes and provide a user-friendly experience in case of page errors.
